# `VSP`
## `V`irtual `S`ales `P`erson  
The Virtual Sales Person application is developed to increase the automation in luxurious showrooms, exhibiting various car model and maintaining less staff, so that the operation of the showroom can be done at minimal cost. The VSP works with the help of Beacons. A Beacon is a low powered Bluetooth device which repeatedly transmits a single signal that other devices can see and with the help of that signal the devices can act accordingly, depending upon the proximity. Whenever the VSP application is within the proximity of the Beacons, based on the location corresponding information about the cars will automatically pop up giving the technical specifications along with pictures, videos and price of different variant for a specific model car.
